# About The Project




In this Project, I've built a Web3 Dapp called Voting Application, using which one can vote for any candidate of any particular party. The biggest advantage of this Dapp is that it is completely decentralized, i.e it has complete security. As of now I've built the Smart Contract and Deployed it using truffle. Currently, I'm developing the Front-End of the Dapp and completing it.


Use the `README.md` to get started.
